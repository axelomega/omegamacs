OMEGAMACS INSTALLATION GUIDE
============================

Real Emacs for real developers - code as config

REQUIREMENTS
------------

- Emacs 27.1 or later
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Bash shell (for running the install script)
- Debian Linux (install script tested on Debian only, see note below)

Optional:
- Language servers (clangd, pyright, etc.) for LSP support
- Node.js 18+ (for GitHub Copilot integration)

PLATFORM NOTE: The automated install script is currently tested on Debian
Linux only (including WSL with Debian). Other Linux distributions should
work but are untested. macOS, Windows (Git Bash/MSYS2/Cygwin), and other
Unix users should use manual installation (see below) or contribute platform
support via pull request. Manual installation works on all platforms.


QUICK INSTALLATION
------------------

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/axelomega/omegamacs.git ~/omegamacs

2. Run the installation script:

   cd ~/omegamacs
   ./install.sh

3. Follow the prompts:
   - The script will handle any existing .emacs or .emacs.d
   - It will ask about performance optimization for NFS home directories
   - Configuration templates will be copied to ~/.emacs.d/

4. Review and customize your configuration:

   $EDITOR ~/.emacs.d/init.el

   The init.el file contains all configuration options with detailed
   comments. Uncomment and modify settings as needed - it's real
   Emacs Lisp, no abstractions!

5. Start Emacs:

   emacs

   Packages will be installed automatically on first startup.


WHAT THE INSTALL SCRIPT DOES
-----------------------------

The install script follows the "code as config" philosophy and keeps
things simple:

1. Checks for Emacs installation
2. Handles existing .emacs file (backup or delete)
3. Handles existing .emacs.d directory (backup or delete)
4. Copies configuration templates to ~/.emacs.d/
5. Sets the omegamacs directory path automatically
6. Optionally configures local storage for NFS setups
7. Directs you to edit init.el yourself

The script does NOT ask endless questions - instead it sets up the
basics and lets you edit the real Emacs Lisp configuration files
directly.


CUSTOM INSTALLATION LOCATION
-----------------------------

If you cloned omegamacs to a location other than ~/omegamacs, the
install script will automatically detect this and configure the path
correctly.

Example:
   git clone https://github.com/axelomega/omegamacs.git ~/my-emacs
   cd ~/my-emacs
   ./install.sh


PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
------------------------

If your $HOME directory is on a network filesystem (NFS, etc.), the
install script will offer to configure local storage for Emacs data
files. This significantly improves performance by avoiding network I/O
for:

- Package installations and cache
- Backup files
- Undo history
- Native compilation cache

The script will ask for a local storage path (e.g., /tmp/.emacs.d.local)
during installation.


MANUAL INSTALLATION
-------------------

If you prefer not to use the install script, you can install manually:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/axelomega/omegamacs.git ~/omegamacs

2. Copy the templates:

   cp ~/omegamacs/templates/init.el ~/.emacs.d/init.el
   cp ~/omegamacs/templates/early-init.el ~/.emacs.d/early-init.el

3. Edit ~/.emacs.d/init.el and customize as needed

4. Start Emacs


NEXT STEPS AFTER INSTALLATION
------------------------------

1. Review the configuration:
   Open ~/.emacs.d/init.el and read through the available options.
   Uncomment and modify settings to match your preferences.

2. Start Emacs:
   Packages will install automatically on first launch.

3. For best performance, use server mode:

   emacs --daemon      # Start the Emacs server
   emacsclient -c      # Connect to the server

   See README.md for details on setting up automatic daemon startup.

4. For quick terminal edits, set up minimal mode:

   export EDITOR="emacs -nw --minimal"

5. Install optional language servers:

   # C/C++
   sudo apt install clangd    # Ubuntu/Debian
   brew install llvm          # macOS

   # Python
   pip install pyright

6. Explore the features:
   - Press C-c T for theme switching
   - Press C-c o for org-mode GTD commands
   - See README.md for complete feature documentation


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Problem: Packages fail to install
Solution: Check your internet connection and try:
          EMACS_PACKAGE_UPDATE_ENABLE=1 emacs

Problem: Slow startup
Solution: Use server mode (emacs --daemon) for instant connections
          after the initial startup

Problem: Language servers not working
Solution: Install the required language servers (see README.md)

Problem: Configuration conflicts
Solution: The install script should have handled existing configs.
          Check for remaining .emacs or .emacs.d.backup.* files
